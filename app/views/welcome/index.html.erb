      <h2 class="index-guide">Why</h2>
      <p>Because road trips are fun! Planning road trips isn't always as easy, though. We're travel enthusiasts ourselves and we know how much effort goes into planning the perfect trip. Connecting road trippers with the best routes to make the most of their trips is why we do what we do. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2 class="index-guide">What</h2>
      <p>We help you plan the perfect road trip. Rather than wade through page after page of possible stops during your roadtrip, then trying to plan out the perfect route to hit each one of them, let us be your guide. We'll give you some suggestions based on where you are and where you're going, and we'll even map out the fastest route so you can make the most of your time. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2 class="index-guide">How</h2>
      <p>We've done our research, and we use our findings to help give you the best suggestions based on what you like and where you're going. Traveling with your family? No problem! We've got some great suggestions for that. More into national parks or monuments, we've got that too. You just tell us what you like, and we'll do the rest. </p>
